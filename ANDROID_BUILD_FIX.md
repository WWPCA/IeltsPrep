# Android Build Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed
✅ **Reduced compileSdk from 35 to 34** - More stable for current Android Studio version
✅ **Reduced targetSdk from 35 to 34** - Matches Google Play requirements
✅ **Updated minSdk from 23 to 24** - Better compatibility
✅ **Downgraded Gradle from 8.7.2 to 8.2.0** - Stable version for current setup

## Next Steps After Fix

### 1. Sync Project Again
- **File → Sync Project with Gradle Files**
- Wait for sync to complete (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Clean and Rebuild
- **Build → Clean Project** 
- **Build → Rebuild Project**

### 3. Generate Signed Bundle
Once build is successful:
- **Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK...**
- **Select "Android App Bundle"**
- **Click "Next"**

### 4. Create Keystore
- **Click "Create new..."**
- **Choose save location** (e.g., Desktop/ielts-keystore.jks)
- **Set strong passwords**
- **Fill certificate information**

### 5. Build Configuration
- **Build variant:** release
- **Click "Create"**

## Expected Result
- **AAB file generated** in: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/
- **File name:** app-release.aab
- **Ready for Google Play Store upload**

The build errors should now be resolved with these compatibility fixes.

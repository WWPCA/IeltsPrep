# IELTS GenAI Prep - System Architecture

## Overview

IELTS GenAI Prep is a comprehensive AI-powered IELTS test preparation platform that has evolved from a Flask-based web application to a pure serverless AWS Lambda architecture. The system provides assessment services for both Academic and General Training IELTS with QR code authentication for seamless mobile-to-web user experiences.

## System Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Pure AWS Lambda Serverless**: Complete migration from Flask to serverless functions
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Global deployment across us-east-1, eu-west-1, and ap-southeast-1
- **API Gateway**: Regional endpoints with automatic routing based on user location
- **WebSocket API**: Real-time bi-directional communication for Nova Sonic streaming

### Frontend Architecture
- **Progressive Web App**: Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Capacitor Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android apps with App Store integration
- **QR Code Authentication**: Seamless authentication flow between mobile app and web platform

### AI Services Integration
- **Amazon Nova Sonic**: Bi-directional speech-to-speech conversations with AI examiner Maya (us-east-1 only)
- **Amazon Nova Micro**: Text processing and assessment evaluation
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket-based audio streaming for speaking assessments

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Mobile-First Authentication**: Users must register and purchase through mobile app first
- **Cross-Platform Login**: Same credentials work on both mobile app and website
- **Session Management**: Standard web session with 1-hour duration after mobile app login
- **Purchase Verification**: Apple App Store and Google Play Store receipt validation in mobile app

### Assessment Engine

- **Native Platform Features**: Leverages Capacitor 7.3.0 for device capabilities
- **Dual-Platform Access**: Users can complete assessments directly in mobile app OR access via desktop/laptop through QR code
- **Flexible User Experience**: One purchase enables access on both mobile and web platforms

## Data Flow

### Purchase-to-Assessment Flow
1. User downloads mobile app and creates account (iOS/Android)
2. User purchases assessment in mobile app with App Store/Google Play billing
3. App Store receipt validation via Lambda backend
4. User can complete assessments directly in mobile app OR login to website using same credentials
5. Website login creates standard web session for desktop access
6. Assessment completion with AI-powered evaluation on either platform

### Speech Assessment Flow
1. User initiates speaking assessment on web platform
2. WebSocket connection established to us-east-1 (global routing)
3. Bi-directional audio streaming with Nova Sonic
4. Real-time conversation with AI examiner Maya
5. Transcript generation and assessment scoring
6. Detailed feedback delivery (no voice data retention)

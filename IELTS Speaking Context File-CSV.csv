Band,Fluency and coherence,Lexical resource,Grammatical range and accuracy  ,Pronunciation
9,"Fluent with only very occasional repetition or
self correction.

not to find words or grammar.
Speech is situationally appropriate and
cohesive features are fully acceptable.
Topic development is fully coherent and
appropriately extended.","Total flexibility and precise use in all contexts.
Sustained use of accurate and idiomatic

convey precise and/or subtle meaning.
Flexible use of features of connected speech is
sustained throughout.
Can be effortlessly understood throughout.
Accent has no effect on intelligibility."
8,"Fluent with only very occasional repetition or
self correction.
Hesitation may occasionally be used to find
words or grammar, but most will be content

Skilful use of less common and idiomatic items despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice
and collocation.
Effective use of paraphrase as required.","Wide range of structures, flexibly used.
The majority of sentences are error free.
Occasional
inappropriacies and non systematic
errors occur. A few basic errors may persist.","Uses a wide range of phonological features to
convey precise and/or subtle meaning.
Can sustain appropriate rhythm. Flexible use of
stress and intonation across long utterances,
despite occasional lapses.
Can be easily understood throughout.
Accent has minimal effect on intelligibility."
7,"Able to keep going and readily produce long
turns without noticeable effort.
Some hesitation, repetition and/or self
correction may occur, often mid sentence and
indicate problems with accessing appropriate
language. However, these will not affect
coherence.
Flexible use of spoken discourse markers,
connectives and cohesive features.","Resource flexibly used to discuss a variety of topics.
Some ability to use less common and idiomatic items and an awareness of style and collocation is evident though inappropriacies occur.
Effective use of paraphrase as required.","A range of structures flexibly used. Error
free sentences are frequent.
Both simple and complex sentences are used effectively despite some errors. A few basic errors persist.","Displays all the positive features of band 6, and
some, but not all, of the positive features of
band 8."
6,"Able to keep going and demonstrates a willingness to
produce long turns.
Coherence may be lost at times as a result of hesitation, repetition and/or self correction.
Uses a range of spoken discourse markers, connectives and cohesive features though not always appropriately.","Resource sufficient to discuss topics at length.
Vocabulary use may be inappropriate but meaning is clear.
Generally able to paraphrase successfully.","Produces a mix of short and complex sentence forms and a variety of structures with limited flexibility.
Though errors frequently occur in complex structures, these rarely impede communication.","Uses a range of phonological features, but control is
variable.
Chunking is generally appropriate, but rhythm may be
affected by a lack of stress timing and/or a rapid speech
rate.
Some effective use of intonation and stress, but this is
not sustained.
Individual words or phonemes may be mispronounced
but this causes only occasional lack of clarity.
Can generally be understood throughout without much
effort."
5,"Usually able to keep going, but relies on repetition and
self correction to do so and/or on slow speech.
Hesitations are often associated with mid
sentence searches for fairly basic lexis and grammar.
Overuse of certain discourse markers, connectives and
other cohesive features.
More complex speech usually causes disfluency but
simpler language may be produced fluently.","Resource sufficient to discuss familiar and unfamiliar
topics but there is limited flexibility.
Attempts paraphrase but not always with success.","Basic sentence forms are fairly well controlled for
accuracy.
Complex structures are attempted but these are limited
in range, nearly always contain errors and may lead to
the need for reformulation.","Displays all the positive features of band 4, and some,
but not all, of the positive features of band 6."
4,"Unable to keep going without noticeable pauses.

Some breakdowns in coherence.","Resource sufficient for familiar topics but only basic meaning can be conveyed on unfamiliar topics.
Frequent inappropriacies and errors in word choice.
Rarely attempts paraphrase.","Can produce basic sentence forms and some short utterances are error free.
Subordinate clauses are rare and, overall, turns are short, structures are repetitive and errors are frequent.","Uses some acceptable phonological features, but the
range is limited.

Isolated words may be recognisable but speech
is of virtually no communicative significance.","Very limited resource. Utterances consist of isolated words or memorised utterances.
Little communication possible without the support of mime or gesture.",No evidence of basic sentence forms.,"Uses few acceptable phonological features
(possibly because sample is

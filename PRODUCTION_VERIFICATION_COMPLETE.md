## ✅ Robots.txt Fix Deployed Successfully

## ✅ All Other Functionality Preserved

**Unchanged Endpoints:**
- Home page: `/` - Working normally
- Login page: `/login` - Working normally  
- Dashboard: `/dashboard` - Working normally
- Assessment pages: `/assessment/*` - Working normally
- API endpoints: `/api/*` - Working normally

**What Was NOT Changed:**
- No database modifications
- No user authentication changes
- No assessment logic alterations
- No mobile app functionality changes
- No payment processing changes
- No other Lambda function modifications

## ✅ Surgical Fix Applied

The deployment was a precise, surgical fix that:
1. Added error handling to prevent robots.txt 500 errors
2. Maintained all AI SEO optimization for crawlers
3. Preserved every other function in the Lambda codebase
4. Left all other systems completely untouched

**Result:** https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/robots.txt now returns proper content instead of internal server error, while all other pages and workflows remain exactly as they were before.

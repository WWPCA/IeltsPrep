The job failed due to missing Apple developer account and provisioning profile configuration:

1. No Accounts: “Add a new account in Accounts settings.”  
2. No profiles for 'com.ieltsaiprep.app': “Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching 'com.ieltsaiprep.app'.”

## Solution

1. **Add an Apple Developer Account**
   - In Xcode, go to `Preferences > Accounts`.
   - Add your Apple ID for the developer account.

2. **Create/Download a Provisioning Profile**
   - Visit the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list).
   - Create or download a development provisioning profile for the App ID `com.ieltsaiprep.app`.
   - Ensure the profile includes the correct device or is set up for automatic signing.

3. **Configure Xcode Project for Code Signing**
   - Open `App.xcodeproj`.
   - Select the target: `App`.
   - In `Signing & Capabilities`, set the correct Team and select the downloaded provisioning profile.

4. **Commit Provisioning Profile and Update Workflow**
   - If building on CI (GitHub Actions), ensure the provisioning profile and signing certificate are securely added to the build agent, often via encrypted secrets and environment variables.
     - Example:
       ```yaml
       # .github/workflows/build-ios.yml
       steps:
         - name: Install provisioning profile
           run: |
             mkdir -p ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles
             echo "${{ secrets.PROVISIONING_PROFILE }}" | base64 --decode > ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles/profile.mobileprovision
       ```
   - Store the profile as a base64-encoded secret in your repository’s settings.

## Summary

- Add your Apple developer account in Xcode on the runner.
- Create/download and configure the necessary provisioning profile for `com.ieltsaiprep.app`.
- Ensure code-signing settings are correct in `App.xcodeproj`.
- Update the CI workflow to install the provisioning profile during build.

**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE  
**Package**: security_enhanced_production_20250721_042353.zip (46.9 KB)  

## Security Vulnerabilities RESOLVED

This deployment fixes critical security gaps in the production robots.txt:

### Before (VULNERABLE):
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /
```

### After (SECURED):
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /login
Disallow: /register  
Disallow: /auth/
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /*.log$
Crawl-delay: 10

User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /
Disallow: /assessment/
Disallow: /api/
Crawl-delay: 60
```

## AWS Lambda Deployment Steps

1. **Access AWS Console** â†’ Lambda Functions
2. **Select Function**: `ielts-genai-prep-api`
3. **Upload Package**: `security_enhanced_production_20250721_042353.zip`
4. **Deploy Code**: Click "Save" to activate
5. **Test Endpoint**: https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/robots.txt

## Post-Deployment Validation

Run these commands to verify security deployment:

```bash
# Authentication protection
curl https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/robots.txt | grep "Disallow: /login"

# API security
curl https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/robots.txt | grep "Disallow: /api/"

# Rate limiting
curl https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/robots.txt | grep "Crawl-delay: 10"

# Security timestamp
curl https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/robots.txt | grep "July 21, 2025"
```

## Expected Results
All commands should return the security-enhanced content, confirming deployment success.

## Security Impact
- Authentication systems protected from bot attacks
- Proprietary IELTS content secured from AI training scraping
- API endpoints protected from discovery and exploitation
- File system secured against unauthorized access
- Enhanced rate limiting active for all crawler types

Deploy immediately to resolve critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security analysis.
